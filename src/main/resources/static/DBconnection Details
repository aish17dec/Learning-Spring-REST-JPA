To connect to database we did following steps:

1. We added these properties in application.properties :

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/socialmediauser
    spring.datasource.username=social-media-user
    spring.datasource.password=dummypassword

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL55Dialect

2. We created a new user in our mysql server with the name 'social-media-user' with this command:
    CREATE USER 'social-media-user'@'localhost';
3. Followed by these 2 commands :
    #On getting error Access denied for :
    ALTER USER 'social-media-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'dummypassword';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'social-media-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "dummypassword";
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
4. You can login to mysql terminal for social media user using this command
    sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u social-media-user -p

5. After connection was successful, ddl statements were not executing due to error
    "Invalid syntax error "type= MyISAM" in DDL generated by Hibernate I had to change
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect from org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect to org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL55Dialect

6. spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto -> To execute create tables statements at the startup of application
